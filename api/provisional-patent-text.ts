Inventor: Tyler Mishoulam
Residence: 10306 Midsummer Meadows, Converse, TX 78109
Application Type: Provisional Patent Application (35 U.S.C. §111(b))
Filing Basis: Establishing priority for subsequent non-provisional utility patent filing.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates generally to insurance claim processing systems and financial disbursement workflows. More specifically, the invention concerns a computerized method and system for routing insurance claim proceeds, managing contractor payments, automating claim follow-up procedures, calculating claim progress, identifying supplemental damage categories, and ensuring regulatory compliance within the context of public adjusting and construction services.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Insurance claim workflows, particularly for property damage claims, lack transparency, consistency, and accountability. Public adjusters, contractors, and insured individuals frequently experience:

- Unclear claim progression timelines.
- Delays caused by homeowners retaining insurance checks.
- Inefficiencies in supplemental claim submissions.
- Payment disputes between homeowners and contractors.
- Lack of structured documentation for collateral damages.
- No unified platform integrating claim status, funds routing, contractor assurance, and compliance.

The absence of an integrated, automated, and legally compliant system results in payment delays, reduced settlement values, contractor uncertainty, and administrative inefficiencies. No system currently provides a combined method for claim progress visibility, automated carrier interactions, trust-account–based funds routing, contractor payment assurance, and analytic-driven collateral damage maximization.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The invention disclosed herein provides a comprehensive software-enabled and workflow-driven system for managing insurance claim processing, routing funds through a controlled trust account, automating supplemental submissions, identifying additional compensable damages, calculating payment readiness, and giving contractors real-time assurance that they will be compensated upon completion of approved work.

The invention integrates the following components:

1. Funds Routing Engine utilizing a public adjuster–controlled trust account, with client authorization, to deposit claim proceeds and disburse payments directly to contractors.
2. Automated Claim Processing Engine that timestamps events, schedules follow-ups, files supplements, issues reminders, and escalates carrier delays.
3. Contractor Assurance Module combining logic rules, claim stage evaluations, payment readiness scoring, and milestone tracking.
4. Collateral Damage Maximization Engine structured to capture additional property damages typically omitted from initial carrier estimates.
5. Regulatory Compliance Layer ensuring operations align with Texas Insurance Code, financial regulations, and public adjusting restrictions.
6. Centralized Claim Status Dashboard showing real-time financial, structural, and procedural claim metrics to authorized users.

The invention materially improves claim efficiency, increases settlement accuracy, enhances contractor confidence, and eliminates payment disputes by removing homeowner control over funds distribution.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

1. System Overview
The invention comprises software, databases, automation protocols, compliance frameworks, and structured workflows. The system may be implemented as a web platform, mobile application, SaaS service, or on-premises software installation.

The system integrates:
- Claim management functions
- Automated follow-up protocols
- Trust-account–based financial routing
- Contractor payment workflows
- Collateral damage analytics
- Compliance checks
- A unified interface for all stakeholders

2. Claim Processing Engine
The system records and manages discrete insurance claim events including:
- First Notice of Loss (FNOL)
- Public Adjuster and Carrier inspections
- Initial estimate issuance
- Supplemental submissions
- Reinspection scheduling
- Settlement approval
- Funds issuance and endorsement

All events are timestamped and stored for audit and compliance.

3. Automated Follow-Up Engine
The system performs time-triggered automated actions, including:
- Carrier communication every predetermined interval
- Automatic escalation if no response is received
- Client reminders for paperwork and endorsements
- Supplemental opportunity alerts

4. Funds Routing and Trust Account System

4.1 Lender Endorsement Acceleration and Check Processing
The system incorporates a lender-coordination subsystem designed to expedite endorsement of insurance proceeds when mortgage lienholders are listed on drafts. The subsystem maintains structured contact pathways, including:
- Designated loss-draft department contacts;
- Lender-specific document checklists;
- Required communication channels (phone, fax, email, portal);
- Escalation procedures for supervisory review.

When a jointly payable check is received, the system:
1. Identifies the applicable lender and retrieves its endorsement requirements.
2. Generates a lender-compliant endorsement packet containing:
   - Claim summary and carrier estimate;
   - Contractor documentation and W-9;
   - Public adjuster authorization forms;
   - Direction-to-Pay documentation;
   - Client identification and loan account data.
3. Transmits the packet to the lender using approved communication methods.
4. Monitors lender response timelines and initiates automated follow-ups.
5. Logs all interactions for audit and compliance purposes.

4.2 Lender Contact Database and Drafting Rules
The system stores lender-specific operational data, including:
- Whether digital submissions are permitted;
- Inspection thresholds for larger claims;
- Requirements for multi-party signatories;
- Documentation necessary for initial and subsequent disbursements;
- Escalation pathways for non-responsive or delayed endorsement departments.

4.3 Proof-of-Repairs Submission to Lender and Carrier
Upon job completion, the system automatically compiles a Proof-of-Repairs package consisting of:
- Completion photos;
- Contractor invoice and certification of completed work;
- Client acknowledgment of completion;
- Updated claim ledger detailing disbursements;
- Carrier-required verification forms.

The system then:
1. Submits the package to the lender to finalize or continue staged releases.
2. Submits required documentation to the carrier to trigger release of recoverable depreciation.
3. Updates claim status in the dashboard accordingly.

4.4 Multi-Stage Lender Release Tracking
The system monitors multi-stage lender release processes by tracking:
- Initial endorsement or partial release;
- Required inspections for subsequent disbursements;
- Final inspection and complete release of remaining funds.

Automated reminders notify clients and contractors of required inspections or lender tasks, reducing delays and ensuring continuous workflow.

5. Supplemental Services, PA Involvement, and AI-Assisted Collaboration
The system incorporates a hybrid public adjusting model in which supplemental services are performed through a combination of licensed public adjuster expertise, contractor input, client preferences, AI-assisted analytical tools, and augmented reality (AR)-enhanced data capture. AI components accelerate documentation review, damage categorization, policy interpretation support, and supplemental opportunity detection; however, human oversight, negotiation, and approval remain central to all decisions. Contractors and insured clients retain decision-making authority regarding when a claim outcome is satisfactory, preventing unnecessary claim prolongation and ensuring that the public adjuster does not extend the process solely to increase the settlement amount.

The system is optimized when the public adjuster is involved at the earliest stage of the claim lifecycle. Preferably, the PA files the First Notice of Loss (FNOL) and manages early evidence collection, which increases claim accuracy, improves settlement outcomes, and shortens total cycle time. To support contractor growth, the system includes optional training modules for roofing companies and their staff. These modules teach best practices for FNOL preparation, documentation, claim intake procedures, and collaboration with the PA throughout the process. Contractors may choose their level of involvement, and the system remains flexible to support their preferred workflow while encouraging early PA participation for superior results.

5.1 Augmented Reality Claim Documentation Using Apple ARKit and RoomScan Technology
The system integrates Apple’s ARKit framework, RoomScan capabilities, and compatible open-source augmented reality measurement tools to improve accuracy, speed, and evidentiary quality in property damage reporting. AR-enabled device scanning allows users to:
- Generate precise 3D interior and exterior structural models;
- Capture real-time spatial measurements with centimeter-grade accuracy;
- Detect slopes, planes, roof facets, openings, penetrations, and elevation changes;
- Automatically embed metadata including timestamps, GPS coordinates, device sensor data, and environmental conditions;
- Produce standardized measurement files (USDZ, OBJ, or point-cloud formats) suitable for claim documentation and estimating software integration.

These AR-generated models and metadata files are automatically uploaded into the system, where they are attached to claim records and used to:
1. Validate loss conditions during FNOL filing;
2. Support supplement requests with precise dimensional evidence;
3. Reduce disputes with carriers by providing verifiable, sensor-based measurements;
4. Accelerate approvals by eliminating manual measurement errors and discrepancies;
5. Enable immediate claim reporting through rapid, on-site scanning.

The integration of AR technologies ensures that claim documentation is consistent, defensible, and collected in a manner that significantly reduces the time between damage inspection and claim submission. This capability enhances both settlement accuracy and processing speed, especially when used in conjunction with the system’s AI analysis modules.

5.2 Hidden-Damage Discovery and Real-Time Supplemental Processing
A unique feature of the system is its ability to detect, document, and process hidden or non-visible structural damages that become apparent only during contractor-performed demolition or roof tear-off. Such conditions—including rotted decking, water-damaged sheathing, concealed mold, degraded insulation, unexpected felt layers, code-deficient materials, and structural defects—cannot be reliably identified through photographs, drones, or AR scanning alone.

The system addresses this by enabling:
1. Real-time contractor discovery reporting, wherein contractors upload photos, videos, and AR-enhanced scans at the moment hidden damage is revealed.
2. Immediate ingestion and classification of hidden-damage evidence through the AI-assisted supplemental engine.
3. Automatic generation of supplemental requests using both AR pre-loss scans and demolition-stage evidence.
4. Instant Direction-to-Pay (DTP) justification, since hidden damages require rapid supplements and material adjustments that cannot wait for client approval.
5. Dynamic claim-value recalculation based on actual, uncovered site conditions.
6. Audit-friendly metadata that ties each discovery to timestamps, contractor credentials, GPS location, and roof-opening sequence.

This workflow increases claim accuracy by ensuring the carrier receives verifiable, real-time documentation of concealed damages that would otherwise be omitted or disputed. With DTP and trust-account routing in place, contractors can proceed confidently with remediation while the system processes required supplemental requests.

5. Contractor Assurance Module
The system controls insurance proceeds using the following process:
1. Insured signs Direction-to-Pay and Proceeds Authorization.
2. Carrier issues payment.
3. Insured endorses payment to the public adjuster’s trust account.
4. System logs deposit and assigns status.
5. Contractor submits invoice.
6. Payment Release Engine verifies readiness.
7. Funds are disbursed directly to contractor.

The system ensures compliance with state regulations, prohibits co-mingling of funds, and maintains complete financial logs.

5. Contractor Assurance Scoring
This module calculates a readiness score based on:
- Claim approval progress
- Supplemental success probability
- Fund readiness
- Escrow deposit status
- Carrier responsiveness

Statuses include:
- Green: Safe to schedule work.
- Yellow: Proceed with caution.
- Red: Delay pending carrier action.

6. Collateral Damage Maximization Engine
Identifies frequently overlooked but claim-eligible damages including exterior structures, fencing, gutters, fixtures, and accessory buildings. Data is structured and auto-attached to supplements.

7. Dashboard Interface
Displays:
- Claim Stage Timeline
- Funds Received
- Funds Pending Endorsement
- Approved Supplements
- Collateral Additions
- Expected Total Settlement
- Payment Readiness Indicators
- Automated Follow-Up Schedules

8. Compliance Layer
The system includes:
- Public adjuster licensing rule enforcement
- Trust account usage constraints
- No-AOB assurance checks
- Recordkeeping protocols
